# Instruction: Create AI-Enhanced TASKS File

You are tasked with creating a TASKS.md file that serves as the execution tracker and current focus for the project. This file is the most frequently updated document and maintains momentum during development sessions.

## TASKS.md Structure Requirements

Create a TASKS.md with these exact sections in order:

### 1. Tasks Header
```markdown
# Current Tasks & Progress

> **AI Context**: This is our active workstream. Check here first to understand current focus.
> For upcoming work see PLANNING.md. For project overview see README.md.

## Generation Instructions

When creating this TASKS.md:

1. **Import from PLANNING**: Pull in appropriate tasks based on:
   - Current phase
   - Completed dependencies  
   - Priority order
   - Team capacity

2. **Break Down Features**: Convert PLANNING.md features into executable tasks:
   - Each task should be completable in one sitting
   - Include clear acceptance criteria
   - Add technical approach hints

3. **Maintain Focus**: 
   - Limit active tasks to 3-5
   - Keep sprint scope realistic
   - One main epic per sprint

4. **Update Frequency**:
   - Task status: Immediately when changed
   - Progress log: During implementation
   - Standup notes: Daily
   - Sprint stats: Daily

5. **Task Writing Guidelines**:
   - Start with a verb (Build, Fix, Refactor, Add, Update)
   - Be specific about what and where
   - Include acceptance criteria
   - Add effort estimates

## AI Coding Session Best Practices

When an AI uses this file during a coding session:

### Starting a Session
1. Read "Currently Working On" section first
2. Check for any blockers
3. Review progress log to understand context
4. Continue from last stopping point

### During Development
1. Update progress log with completed steps
2. Add notes about decisions or discoveries
3. Move tasks to appropriate status
4. Document any new blockers immediately

### Ending a Session
1. Update "Currently Working On" with current state
2. List files modified
3. Add notes for next session
4. Commit changes with descriptive message

## Task Lifecycle

```
Sprint Backlog ‚Üí Current Sprint ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed
                      ‚Üì
                  Blocked (if issues arise)
```

## Integration with Other Files

- **FROM PLANNING.md**: Import epics and features for current sprint
- **TO README.md**: Update "Current Sprint Focus" section
- **REFER TO README.md**: For technical patterns and conventions

## Remember

TASKS.md is your execution heartbeat:
- Update it frequently (multiple times per day)
- Keep it focused on current work only
- Move completed items to archive after sprint
- Use it to maintain context between coding sessions

The goal is to always know exactly what to work on next and maintain momentum throughout the sprint.

## Usage Example

To use this instruction with an AI assistant:

```
"Read AI-TASKS-INSTRUCTION.md and create a TASKS.md for my project.

Current context:
- Sprint: [Name/number]
- Working on: [Current epic from PLANNING.md]
- Team size: [Number of developers]
- Sprint length: [1 or 2 weeks]
- Previous sprint completed: [What was done]
- Current blockers: [Any known issues]"
```

The AI will create an actionable task tracker that maintains focus and momentum throughout your sprint.
