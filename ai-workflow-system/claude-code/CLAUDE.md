# AI Workflow System Configuration

## Overview
This project uses the 3-file AI workflow system for structured development.

## Workflow Instructions
- **Initialize Project**: Use `/init-project` to set up all three files
- **Create README**: Use `/create-readme` for AI-enhanced documentation
- **Create Planning**: Use `/create-planning` for strategic roadmap
- **Create Tasks**: Use `/create-tasks` for execution tracking

## File Structure
Every project should maintain:
1. **README.md** - Vision & Architecture (AI-enhanced)
2. **PLANNING.md** - Strategic roadmap and epics
3. **TASKS.md** - Current sprint and execution tracking

## Standards Location
- Instructions: @~/.ai-workflow/instructions/
- Commands: @~/.claude/commands/

## Workflow Guidelines
1. Start with `/init-project` for new projects
2. Update TASKS.md daily during development
3. Update PLANNING.md weekly after sprint reviews
4. Update README.md when architecture changes
